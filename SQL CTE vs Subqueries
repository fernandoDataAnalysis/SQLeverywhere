Here we can find two differente ways to have the same output by using subqueries or cte.

First query by twoo opcions

##With subquery
SELECT country.country,
COUNT(DISTINCT country.country_id) AS top_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT customer.customer_id) AS all_customer_count
FROM 
(SELECT  A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country, 
SUM (amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON E.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY   A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid desc
LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers
LEFT JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = customer.customer_id
LEFT JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
LEFT JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
LEFT JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
GROUP BY country.country_id
ORDER BY COUNT (country.country) DESC 
limit 5

##with cte
WITH customers_country_cte AS
(SELECT  A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country, 
SUM (amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON E.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY   A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid desc
LIMIT 5) 
SELECT country.country_id,
 COUNT (DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
 COUNT (DISTINCT customers_country_cte.country_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM
customer A 
LEFT JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = customer.customer_id
LEFT JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
LEFT JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
LEFT JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
LEFT JOIN  customers_country_cte ON country.country_id  = customers_country_cte.country_id
GROUP BY country.country_id
ORDER BY COUNT (country.country) DESC 
limit 5

Second querie by two options.

##With subquery
SELECT AVG (total_amount_paid) AS average
FROM 
(SELECT  A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country, 
SUM (amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON E.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY   A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid desc
LIMIT 5) AS average

##CTE
WITH average_cte AS 
(SELECT  A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country, 
SUM (amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON E.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY   A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid desc
LIMIT 5) 
SELECT ROUND( AVG (total_amount_paid), 2) AS average_amount_paid
FROM average_cte
